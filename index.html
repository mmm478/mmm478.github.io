      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American commerical operators and Bristish and Russian national expeditions began exploring the Antartic peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic Circle. Not until 1840 was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent and not merely a group of islands or an area of ocean.</p>

        <p>Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in the early 20th century, but generally the area saw little human activity.Following World War II, however, the continent experienced an upsurge in scientific research. A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims, but most countries do not recognize these claims.</p>

        <p>In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in 1959, it entered into force in 1961.  Also relevant to Antarctic governance are the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.</p>

        <h3>Location</h3>

          <p>Antarctica is located south of the Antarctic Circle</p>

        <h3>Area</h3>

          <p><strong>Total:</strong> 14.2 million <abbr>sq km</abbr></p>
          <p><strong>Land:</strong> 14.2 million <abbr>sq km</abbr></p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> fifth-largest continent, following Asia, Africa, North America, and South America, but larger than Australia and the subcontinent of Europe </p>

        <h3>Climate</h3>

          <p>The coldest, windiest, and driest continent on Earth; severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below freezing; summers characterized by continuous daylight, while winters bring continous darkness; persistent high pressure over the interior brings dry, subsiding air that results in very little cloud cover</p>

      <h2>Communications<h2>

        <h3>Telecommunications System</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><p>General Assessment: local systems at some research stations (2019)</p>
            <li><p>Domestic: commercial cellular networks operating in a small number of locations (2019)</p>
            <li><p>international: country code - none allocated; via satellite (including mobile Inmarsat and Iridium systems) to and from all research stations, ships, aircraft, and most field parties</p>
          </ul>

        <h3>Internet country code<h3>

          <p>Antarctica's county code is .aq</p>
          <p> The region's website can be found at <a href="https://www.state.gov/key-topics-office-of-ocean-and-polar-affairs/antarctic/">Antarctic Region</a></p>

        <h3>Internet users</h3>

          <p><strong>Total</strong> 4,400</p>
          <p><strong>Percent of population:</strong> 100% (July 2016 est.)</p>

      <h2>Transportation</h2>

        <h3>Heliports</h3>

          <p>53 (2012)
          note: all year-round and seasonal stations operated by National Antarctic Programs stations have some kind of helicopter landing facilities, prepared (helipads) or unprepared </p>

        <h3>Ports and terminals</h3>

          <p>most coastal stations have sparse and intermittent offshore anchorages; a few stations have basic wharf facilities</p>

        <h3>Transportation note</h3>

          <p>US coastal stations include McMurdo (77 51 S, 166 40 E) and Palmer (64 43 S, 64 03 W); government use only; all ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with Article 7, Antarctic Treaty; relevant legal instruments and authorization procedures adopted by the states parties to the Antarctic Treaty regulating the Antarctic Treaty area have to be complied with (see "Legal System"); The Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica (HCA), a commission of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), is responsible for hydrographic surveying and nautical charting matters in Antarctic Treaty area; it coordinates and facilitates provision of accurate and appropriate charts and other aids to navigation in support of safety of navigation in region; membership of HCA is open to any IHO Member State whose government has acceded to the Antarctic Treaty and which contributes resources or data to IHO Chart coverage of the area</p>
